# WirelessDT: A Digital Twin Platform for Real-Time Evaluation of Wireless Software Applications

WirelessDT, is a **Wireless** **D**igital **T**win Platform, for Wireless Software Applications (WSAs) Evaluation.

In this [ICSE2023 DEMO Video](https://youtu.be/9Kl-3jgMBUA), we evaluate a wireless indoor localisation mobile application with two typical prediction algorithms: 1) Kalman Filter-based Trilateration and 2) Deep Recurrent Neural Network, as a case study to demonstrate the capabilities of WirelessDT. 

## Abstract

Wireless technology has become one of the most important parts of our daily routine. Besides being used for communication, the wireless signal has been applied to various Wireless Software Applications (WSAs). The signal fluctuation caused by the measurement system or the environmental dynamic can lead to nonnegligible influences on WSA performance. However, quantitative and qualitative real-time evaluation of WSAs is challenging due to limited resources and intractable practical issues. To overcome these challenges, we propose WirelsssDT, a wireless digital twin platform, using digital twin and real-time ray tracing technologies to emulate the signal propagation and generate emulation data for real-time WSAs evaluation.
