    "> Communication quality can vary dramatically over time, and has been reputed to change with slight spatial displacements.\n",

    "> Wireless sensor networks will be deployed in harsh (粗糙), inaccessible, environments which almost by definition will exhibit (展现) **significant multi-path communication**. \n",
    "> Many of the current sensor platforms use **low-power radios which do not have enough frequency diversity (频率分集) to reject multi-path propagation**.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> This paper attempt to get a quantitative understanding of wireless communication in sensor networks.\n",
    "> We systematically evalutate the packet delivery. \n",
    "> \n",
    "> * At the physical layer (PHY), the physical-layer and in the absence(缺乏) of interfering transmission, packet delivery performance is largely a function of the environment, the particular physical layer coding scheme, and perhaps the individual receiver characteristics. We study **the efficacy (效能) of packet delivery** under different transmit powers and physical layer codings.\n",
    "> * At the medium access layer (MAC), interfering transmission contribute to poor packet delivery performance. We study **efficacy of MAC layers contain mechanisms**.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Discovered Phenomena:\n",
    "> * There are heavy tails in the distributions of packet loss, both at the physical layer and at the MAC layer.\n",
    "> * At the MAC layer, link-layer retransmissions are unable to reduce the variability; packet losses at the MAC layer also exhibit heavy tails."
